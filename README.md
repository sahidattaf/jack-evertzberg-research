## 🗂️ Folder Structure & `.gitkeep` Usage

This repo uses `.gitkeep` files to ensure essential folders (like `roadmap/`, `assets/`, `teaser/`, and `tokenization/`) remain tracked by Git even when empty.

`.gitkeep` is a convention that helps maintain folder structure in version control. These files can be safely deleted when actual content is added.

Maintained folders:
- `teaser/` – investor PDFs
- `roadmap/` – release plans
- `tokenization/` – smart contracts
- `assets/` – images/maps
- `research/` – markdown analysis
